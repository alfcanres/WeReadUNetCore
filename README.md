This is a simple WebApp build just to make an example of basic SOLID principles, design patterns and good practices. 
The idea is to develop a Back-End REST service and a Front-End Apps to consume the services. 
The App it's called "We Read U" and it's intended to be kind of like a blog/twitter where people can post poems, verses, or any thougts as long as they are short. Other users are able to vote for every post.
